# WearCare - Make the smart watch more smarter with care
WearCare is a small start to integrate healthcare features into wearables.

# What is it?

Health care is an essential part of everyday life for all. Our human body needs a periodic monitoring of health parameters and right treatments based on this data. Health care becomes more important when people reach a certain age and in that age following their health condition without proper guided assistance is becoming tedious.

There are 3 main factors that are very important from a health perspective.
- Follow the medications.
- Continuous monitoring of vital parameters Eg., Heart rate, ECG
- Better sleep

In many cases, these factors are getting missed due to no personal reminder system that is very close or sometimes might be due laziness. As a solution, we are placing an app called wearcare (wearable app) very close to the user, meaning that a user is generally a click away from the data. Nowadays, wearables have become more close to humans than mobile phones and possess a variety of capabilities and can assist old or disabled people in health care.

To be concise, the technology in hands. Wear the care now. So;

- It helps to keep the medication properly with reminders and refills with auto order too.
- It helps doctors to update the medications remotely based on the patient reports.
- It assures that the doctor gets updates daily about the health condition of their patients. (Heart rate, Medication status, Sleep quality, Walking)

# How can it be done?
This can be achieved with,
- Few cups of coffee
- Java
- WearOS
- Firebase
- Obviously, your support and suggesstions

# How will it be?
