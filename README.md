# What is it?

Healthcare is an essential part of everyday life for all. Our human body needs a periodic monitoring of health parameters and right treatments based on this data. Healthcare becomes more important when people reach a certain age and in that age following their health condition without proper assistance is becoming tedious.

There are 3 main factors that are very important from a health perspective.
- Follow the medications.
- Continuous monitoring of vital parameters Eg., Heart rate, ECG
- Better sleep

In many cases, these factors are getting missed due to **no personalized healthcare based reminder system** or sometimes might be due to laziness. As a solution, an app is designed called **WearCare** (wearable app), that a user is generally a click away from the care. Nowadays, wearables have become more close to humans than mobile phones and possess a variety of capabilities that can assist old/disabled people. 

Wear device on the userâ€™s wrist, makes it perfect piece of hardware for the healthcare use cases. To be concise, the technology in hands. Wear the care now. So;

- It helps to keep the medication properly with reminders and refills with auto order too.
- It helps doctors to update the medications remotely based on the patient reports.
- It assures that the doctor gets updates daily about the health condition of their patients. (Heart rate, Medication status, Sleep quality, Walking)
